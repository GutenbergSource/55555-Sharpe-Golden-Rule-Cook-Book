<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The arranging of this help for those who are seeking
to obey the call to a higher humanitarianism, which is put forth by
non-flesh-eating men and women, has been a labour of love: the labour,
the result of an earnest endeavour to so write the receipts that
&ldquo;the way-faring woman may not err therein,&rdquo; the love, of a
kind whose integrity may not be questioned, since it has inspired to
the never easy task of going against the stream of habit and custom,
and to individual effort in behalf of the myriads of gentle and
amenable creatures, which an animality that defiles the use of the word
has accustomed man to killing and eating.</p>
<p>The name Vegetarian has come to mean one who abstains from animal
flesh as food; and, as some designation is necessary, it is perhaps a
sufficiently suitable one. This term did not, however, originally
classify those who used a bloodless diet, but is derived from the Latin
<i>Homo Vegitus</i>, which words described to the Romans a strong,
vigorous man. The definition of the word <i>Vegitus</i>, as given in
Thomas Holyoke&rsquo;s Latin Dictionary, is &ldquo;whole, sound, quick,
fresh, lively, lusty, gallant, trim, brave,&rdquo; and of
<i>Vegito</i>, &ldquo;to refresh, to re-create.&rdquo; Professor Mayor
of England adds to these definitions: &ldquo;The word vegetarian
belongs to an illustrious family; <i>vegetable</i>, which has been
called its mother, is really its niece.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>The word has unfortunately become intermingled with various dietetic
theories, but the Vegetarian who is one because his conscience for one
reason or another condemns the eating of flesh, occupies a very
different place in the world of ethics from one who is simply
refraining from meat eating in an effort to cure bodily ills.</p>
<p>Indeed, the dyspeptic frequenting the usual Vegetarian restaurant
has little opportunity to know much about vegetables as food, the menu
being, as a rule, so crowded with various mixtures which are supposedly
&ldquo;meat substitutes&rdquo; that vegetables pure and simple find
small place. This book contains no meat substitutes, as such, but
receipts for the palatable preparation of what is called by many
&ldquo;live foods,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, food which has no blood to
shed and does not, therefore, become dead before it can be eaten.</p>
<p>There will also be found lacking from the index such dishes as
&ldquo;Vegetarian Hamburg Steak,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pigeon Pie, Vegetarian
style,&rdquo; etc., which should repel rather than attract, by bringing
to mind what Bernard Shaw has graphically spoken of as &ldquo;scorched
carcasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been proven by myself and my household that flesh eating may
be safely stopped in one day with no injury to health or strength, and
that a table supplied from the receipts in this book can make those
whom it furnishes with food well and strong as far as food can make
them so.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why thoughtful, cleanly, humane people should
not feed upon animals, but there is a surprising deafness to this fact
shown by the majority of those active in humane charities. One marvels
to see hundreds of consecrated workers in session, putting forth every
effort for the enacting of laws for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>amelioration of the
sufferings of cattle travelling to slaughter by car and ship, who are
still content to patronise the butcher shop to buy food supplied by the
dead bodies of these tortured victims of a false appetite. Mere
thoughtlessness can make the kindest act cruelly inconsistent, for I
once saw a woman presiding at a meeting held to discountenance the
wearing of aigrettes with a sheaf of them decorating her bonnet. This
looks much like receiving stolen goods while denouncing theft.</p>
<p>It is well to write, and legislate, and pray for better and kinder
treatment of these frightened, thirst-maddened, tortured creatures on
their journey to our tables, but the surest, quickest way to help (and
this can be done even while continuing to work for the alleviation of
their sufferings) is to stop feeding upon them.</p>
<p>In a recent issue of a paper devoted to humane matters there is an
indignant protest against the sufferings endured by crated chickens in
a certain market, and another article deplores the cruelty shown to
turtles in the same place, but when we know the writers of these
protests to be still willing to use these creatures on their tables, it
is not always easy to fully credit their tender-heartedness. In another
such paper there appear from year to year sentimental pictures and
poems extolling the kindliness and virtues of &ldquo;the cattle upon a
thousand hills,&rdquo; while those same pages print instructions on the
most humane way of slaying them, giving as a reason for the sudden and
painless death described that suffering &ldquo;poisons the
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The favourite phrase, &ldquo;our four-footed friends,&rdquo; seems
rather an anachronism in the face of our acknowledged relations to them
as eater and eaten, for the phrase indicates a mutual pact of
friendship, which, however well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>sustained by them, is
dishonoured by man; for even cannibals, we are told, sink no lower than
to eat their foes.</p>
<p>The demand for butcher&rsquo;s meat may not seem materially lessened
because I do not eat it, but it is lessened notwithstanding, and I
rejoice to know that in the past seven years my abstinence from flesh
must have resulted in a little less slaughter, and I am glad to have
reduced by even one drop the depth of that ocean of blood. I have heard
the Biblical statement that man was to have dominion over all the earth
quoted as a justification for the eating of the lower animals. We will
some day be so civilised that we will recognise the great truth that
dominion implies care, and guardianship, and protection rather than the
right to destroy.</p>
<p>The first objection voiced against Vegetarianism is not usually
against its principle, but its practice; we are told that the refusal
to eat meat causes inconvenience, and that it is best to &ldquo;eat
what is set before you, asking no questions for conscience&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo; I could respect the position of one who literally believed
and consistently acted on this mandate, but where in Christendom can he
be found? Few of us could or would eat the flesh of a pet lamb, or
partake knowingly of horse flesh, or could or would feel called upon to
dine on these lines with the peoples who eat dog, or with so-called
cannibals. The host might have secured, in a broad spirit of
hospitality, just the particular carcass which most pleased his own
palate, but courtesy seldom forces us to eat any flesh other than the
sorts to which our own habits have accustomed us.</p>
<p>There is a well-known story of an American statesman who was reared
by Vegetarian parents in the country, and taken while still a small boy
to dine at a neighbour&rsquo;s. During the progress of the meal a large
platter was borne <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span>into the room, on which lay something the
like of which he had not seen on any table. He stared in wonder, and
finally located the resemblance and shouted, &ldquo;Why, mother, if
that isn&rsquo;t a dead hen!&rdquo; Habit had not overcome his horror
of that particular dead thing as food, as it would have done had he
seen dead hens served as food all his life.</p>
<p>As to the inconvenience caused my friends when I am at their tables,
I consider it of such small consequence compared to the fact that even
one child should be standing almost knee-deep in blood in some
slaughter-house, working to supply my wants, that it is not worth a
second thought. No one need go hungry from any well-planned dinner,
even though no extra preparation has been made for the non-meat-eating
guest; but if my hostess knows in advance that I do not eat meat, and
wishes to have prepared an especial dish, I give her the benefit of the
doubt, and believe that she is as pleased to do it as I would be in her
place. We like to take a little extra trouble to entertain our friends,
and the thought expended to give others pleasure is perhaps the real
joy of hospitality.</p>
<p>Another class of objector likes to remind us that we take life when
we eat vegetables, or drink, or breathe. A friend, who has since ceased
to consider the unnecessary and cruel slaughtering of thousands of
creatures daily a fit subject for joking, once sent me in raillery a
sonnet which rehearsed the sad death suffered by a cabbage to satisfy a
Vegetarian&rsquo;s selfish cravings. I find no qualms in my own
conscience on this subject, but should I ever come to feel as these
over-sensitive claim I should, I hope I will not then eat even the
&ldquo;innocent cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, if the germs in the water we drink and the air we breathe do
die by reason of our drinking and breathing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>I endure
no self-condemnation. Man cannot be required to do the impossible by
any Principle of Good, and to do each day what good he is able to do,
to avoid the evil he can avoid, and in every difficulty choose what he
thinks to be the lesser of two evils, is perhaps as much as even Divine
Love expects of him to-day.</p>
<p>It is well to face the unpleasant fact that there are occasions when
in our present state of development it seems necessary to kill in
self-defence, as it were, moths, rats, etc.; but even in this we can
&ldquo;do our best,&rdquo; and it has been well said, &ldquo;angels can
do no more.&rdquo; We can by care in our households greatly reduce this
necessity, and we can always see that no creatures, although destroying
our property, pilfering or stealing, are in their death made to suffer.
In this connection I would urge every one who reads these lines to
never permit a piece of sticky fly-paper to be brought into the house,
for of all cruel ways of destruction, this slow method, by which the
unfortunate fly almost dismembers itself in its frantic efforts to
escape, is one of the most fiendishly contrived.</p>
<p>An advocate of Vegetarianism has truly said, &ldquo;A vegetable diet
is as little connected with weakness and cowardice as meat eating is
with physical force and courage.&rdquo; That Vegetarians are not
physical weaklings is no mere matter of opinion, but is proven by the
giant Japanese wrestlers; the ancient Greek wrestlers; those Indian
regiments of the British army showing most endurance; by the peasantry
of the world, which is seldom able to afford meat, and above all, by
those famous Vegetarians who march around the globe doing the work
carnivorous man is too weak to do,&mdash;the horse, the ox, the camel,
and the elephant. One of our best-known cooking teachers and food
experts printed this statement not long ago: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>&ldquo;While meat seems necessary to the rapid
development of the American, I must contend that a well-selected
vegetable diet will give greater health, bodily vigour, and mental
strength,&rdquo; which would seem contradictory, for even an American
would not seem to require other food than that which will give him
greatest health, bodily vigour, and mental strength.</p>
<p>Nor have we cause to feel ashamed of the mentality of the guests at
Ceres&rsquo; table, which is graced by a goodly company; the list of
names encircling the cover of &ldquo;The Vegetarian Magazine&rdquo;
reads, &ldquo;Adam, Hesiod, Gautama, Isaiah, Daniel, Plato, Zoroaster,
Aristotle, Seneca, Ovid, Plutarch, Pope, Swedenborg, Leonardo da Vinci,
Voltaire, Franklin, Westley, Linn&aelig;us, Shelley, Tolstoi, and King
Oscar II.&rdquo; Others are Bernard Shaw, and Maurice Maeterlinck (who
is said to have become a non-meat eater to gain greater endurance for
his favourite pastime of mountain climbing), Richard Wagner, and
General Booth.</p>
<p>But after all, the one great argument for a fleshless diet is the
humanitarian one, and it does not seem possible that persons exist
to-day who do not know of the horrors of cruelty which take place
hourly, in order that meat may be eaten by men and women who could not
look without sickening at the process which has made possible the roast
upon their tables, but who are nevertheless the employers of every
fainting child in the stock-yards, and every brutalised man in the
shambles, whose wages they pay with every pound of meat they buy. The
real butcher of an animal is the one for whom it receives its death
blow, not the one who actually deals that blow.</p>
<p>A man who recently visited some stock-yards writes: &ldquo;We were
sorry to see the <i>Thor</i> man make mislicks at a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>pretty
heifer. His first stroke did not fell her, and she staggered and looked
at him so wonderingly and pathetically. He could not strike her while
her head was in that position, and after giving her two or three more
ineffectual blows, she looked at him so reproachfully, as if pleading,
&lsquo;Why do you treat me so cruelly? What have I ever done to
you?&rsquo; Finally he got her down and out of her misery. I shall
never take a bit of steak on my fork without seeing that pretty heifer
lifting her stunned head to that awkward pounder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing more revolting than this same writer&rsquo;s remarks
anent pig-killing has been written, but since the words are accurately
true, they should be fit to read, for if the <i>words</i> which tell
the truth about meat as food are unfit for our ears, the <i>meat</i>
itself is not fit for our mouths. He describes the pig-sticking, the
skinning, and the process which makes the pig into pork, and then adds:
&ldquo;He goes into the cooling room, and the whole effort from that
time is to keep him from crumbling back into dust, attacked by worms.
Salt and brine and smoke and cold prevent the corpse from utter
dissolution. The refrigerator is a sort of Purgatory where the brute
stays until he finally finds a cemetery in the human alimentary
canal.&rdquo; Yet this man expects to again have meat &ldquo;on his
fork&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; calls attention to the remarkable
procession daily passing through a certain slaughter-house, as follows:
&ldquo;Imagine a procession of 10,000 cattle marching two by two, in a
line fifteen miles long; let 20,000 sheep follow them, bleating along
twelve miles of road; after them drive sixteen miles of hogs, 27,000
strong; then let 30,000 fowls bring up the rear, clucking and quacking
and gobbling, over a space of six miles; and in this whole caravan,
stretching for nearly fifty miles and requiring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>two days
to pass a given point, you will see the animals devoted to death in the
packing houses of &mdash;&mdash; &amp; Co. in a single day. Surely a
Buddhist would think that the head of that establishment had much to
answer for. Never before in the world&rsquo;s history was a massacre of
the innocents organised on such a stupendous scale or with such
scientific system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People are <span class="corr" id="xd25e424" title=
"Source: suprisingly">surprisingly</span> callous to the sufferings of
those animals destined to become food. Recently some well-dressed,
well-mannered men were on a train returning East from a Western visit,
and the train coming to a standstill for some reason, their
conversation was plainly overheard by their fellow-passengers. They
were discussing a visit to the stock-yards, and one of them, quite
convulsed with laughter, cried out that he really thought the most
comical sight he had seen while away, in fact one of the funniest
things he had seen in his whole life, was the antics of a pig
&ldquo;which had escaped out of the scalding pen!&rdquo; The
pig-sticker had evidently been as awkward that time as the man who
missed the pretty heifer.</p>
<p>It is daily less possible to buy turkeys and chickens minus their
heads. The delicate death without the use of the old-time axe (which we
degraded men and women have thought a pretty symbol to place on
Thanksgiving Day table cards) is brought about by hanging the fowls up
by the feet, in what fright can be imagined, an incision is then made
in the roof of the mouth, and after bleeding to death, which, as in the
case of calves or veal, insures solid white flesh, they are served as
food to dainty women who can scarcely bear to kill a fly, and alas! to
some members of the societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals!</p>
<p>One crate of chickens can encase more suffering than I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>want
endured for me. There is first the terror in capture, then the
suffering of being thrust, legs often tied, in the small over-crowded
crate, then the journey in the shrieking train, and the thirst-tortured
hours in the sun before the final twist of the neck or the blow of the
axe, given in many cases just before natural death would render the
fowl unfit for sale. And such food, poisoned by fear and suffering, is
considered the most delicate, and thought fit to feed to invalids!</p>
<p>That all chickens do not endure the same suffering before death is
no excuse for eating them, for some will have to submit to it while
chicken is an article of food. The modern invention of fattening fowl
by the machine-stuffing method, to make what are called in England
&ldquo;Surrey fowls,&rdquo; and in America are given various fancy
names, is so revolting that it almost makes one faint to read a true
account of it. We are selfishly prone to comfort ourselves when these
things are brought to our notice with the thought that the lower
creatures do not suffer as we would. The fact is that no two live
beings suffer the same in any event, physical or mental, but the lower
animal or bird or fish suffers in its fear and death all it is capable
of suffering, and we have no right to make any creature do this for our
pleasure.</p>
<p>Mr. E. Bell has written, &ldquo;Dreadful are the revelations made by
humane men, who, setting aside personal comfort and peace of mind, have
endeavoured to sound the depths of animal agony and bloodshed. The
process of flaying alive, and even of dismembering animals before the
breath has left their bodies, is far from uncommon in private
slaughter-houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we witness the cruelty to horses on our streets, though they
are property which the most unwise would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>naturally seek to care
for, we can only imagine what must chance to the unfortunate creatures,
already condemned to death and only regarded as food, at the hands of
the hardened men whose miserable lot it is to be employed by
Christendom to do its most evil work.</p>
<p>In a pamphlet called &ldquo;An Epitome of Vegetarianism&rdquo; C. P.
Newcombe writes: &ldquo;Our opponents are quick to point out the
supposed resemblance between the canine teeth of man and those of the
carnivora, forgetting that they are even more prominent in the ape, the
horse, and the camel. We accept the challenge and appeal for an
authoritative statement of the facts to the great masters of science,
among whom there is complete agreement, viz., that expressed by Baron
Cuvier, the Professor of Natural History in the College of France, who
wrote in &lsquo;The Animal Kingdom,&rsquo; vol. i, page 88:
&lsquo;Fruits, roots, and the other succulent parts of vegetables
appear to be the natural food of man; his hands afford him a facility
for gathering them, and his short and comparatively weak jaws, his
short canine teeth, not passing beyond the common line of others, and
his tuberculous cheek teeth would not permit him either to feed upon
herbage or devour flesh unless these aliments were previously prepared
by the culinary process.&rsquo; Similar opinions are expressed by Sir
Charles Bell, F. R. S., Prof. William Lawrence, F. R. S., Sir Richard
Owen, K. C. B., F. R. S., and Dr. Charles Darwin, with many
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While interesting in stating a case, this interests me as an
argument but little, for if we were carnivorously made, with our minds,
our hearts, our capacity for love and charity, and that great hope we
have of finally manifesting the perfection of the sons of God, we still
should control our tendencies by a higher law, and no more be
carnivorous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>than we are apes, or marauders, or any other
mental or physical manifestation from which spiritual evolution has
lifted us high.</p>
<p>But this humanitarianism does not consider alone the animals
slaughtered, but the men, women, and children who do this revolting
work. One packing-house in the West advertises over 18,000 employees;
multiply this by thousands and one can estimate the numbers of human
beings who are thus degraded and brutalised. In my own household I have
made it a point of honour to demand no labour which I would not be
willing to do myself; I might fail in strength, but morally I would be
willing to undertake any work required by me, and from the day I
realised what I required from others if I ate meat, I became an
abstainer from it, for no surer ethical truth can be stated than that
we have no moral right to demand from the hands of another, work we
would not be willing to undertake ourselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry Salt has written, &ldquo;Of all recognised occupations,
the work which is looked upon with the greatest loathing (next to the
hangman&rsquo;s) is that of the butcher&mdash;the trade of doing to
death countless numbers of inoffensive and highly organised creatures,
amid scenes of indescribable filth and ferocity&mdash;is delegated to a
pariah class of slaughter-men, who are thus themselves made the victims
of a grievous social wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So large a percentage of the murderers of to-day have been butchers,
they or their fathers before them, that these statistics alone
constitute a sufficient argument for Vegetarianism.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s inhumanity to himself in this matter of flesh eating is
rapidly being uncovered by meat inspectors, food experts, and hundreds
of physicians the world over. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href=
"#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>The statistics comparing meat-eating
and non-meat-eating races with regard to tuberculosis, cancer,
appendicitis, etc., are of the greatest interest to those who care not
only for the health but for the mere cleanness of their bodies.</p>
<p>Dr. B. W. Richardson, in a book called &ldquo;The Field of
Disease,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;In Jewish communities there are a number
of men set apart to act as inspectors of animal food. They attend at
the slaughter-houses, and after an animal is slain and dressed they
submit it to inspection; then, unless they put upon it their sign, that
it is free from disease, it is not permitted to enter a Jewish family.
It enters into the families outside the Jewish community, so that we
who are not Jews actually accept into our bodies food which the Jews
have rejected as diseased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statistics taken from two small abattoirs alone, for one year,

<p>According to this very nearly one-third of all the meat sold to
Christian families is tainted by parasitical disease. If an animal dies
of cancer, tuberculosis, etc., our laws protect us from the carcass,
but, if slaughtered, the diseased portion is cut away and the remainder
is sold as fit for food. <i>Such</i> blood is squeezed from beef and
poured by the gallon by loving hands into the willing lips of
consumptives and an&aelig;mics! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"

<p>The true Vegetarian will not be seen adorned (?) by any of the
reapings from a dead body, whether they be feathers or furs, for these
have no beauty in the sight of those who see them in thought, dripping
with the blood from which they can never be truly cleansed.</p>
<p>Those who would &ldquo;strain at gnats&rdquo; while swallowing
camels, criticise the Vegetarian for his kid gloves and his leather
shoes; but perfect conditions do not yet prevail for the absolutely
consistent carrying out of his principles; his effort is to help to
bring these to pass, and he does not refrain from beginning for the
reason that he cannot yet do all. An adequate substitute for leather
has been made which experiments have proven of value, but, as yet,
there is no demand which justifies its manufacture.</p>
<p>Many express the fear that, were wholesale slaughter abolished, the
earth would be overrun by the lower animals; but were artificial and
unnatural breeding discontinued we can safely trust that the animal
creation would find its proper place in the world, as everything does,
under the guidance of the controlling Mind which is Creator.</p>
<p>Stop and think for a moment what the world would be like to-day if
it were Vegetarian. If the world were Vegetarian, the endless caravans
of doomed creatures would not be ambling to the shambles; not a man
would be brutalised by the daily slaughter of hundreds of gentle
creatures; not a woman would be engaged in sorting edible parts from
the dissected carcasses, making all red around her; not a child would
be standing deep in offal, seeking useful bits of dead bodies;
&ldquo;where sympathy is, cruelty is impossible,&rdquo; therefore, not
a dog would be maltreated, not a cat selfishly deserted to starve, not
a horse cruelly beaten, and not a vivisectionist could <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>be found
on the face of the earth! Those who had learned to be just to the lower
animals would not fail in their duties to man, and in this millennium,
prophesied in <a class="biblink xd25e45" title=

labourers under the clear sky, tilling the ground to provide the food
of man.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE KITCHEN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no room in the house which requires such
careful furnishing as the kitchen, and much time may be saved there if
the right thing is in the right place, for just as truly as &ldquo;the
means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done,&rdquo; do the means to do
things well tend toward their being done.</p>
<p>To house-builders I would urge that it pays to have a white
enamelled sink, and to insist that no sand-soap or scouring soap be
used on it, as this removes the finish and makes it less easy to keep
it spotless. See that a package of one of the cleaning powders is
placed near the sink, convenient for use the first time the maid looks
about for materials, and over the sink on small hooks have hung two or
three different shaped sink brushes. An enamelled soap-dish should be
fastened above the sink, and on the left of it a grooved, slightly
slanting draining board for washed dishes; hanging under this on a
large hook should be the enamelled dishpan and back of it a wire
drainer, both hanging free from the wall.</p>
<p>Any kitchen can have a chair-rail put around it, and this four-inch
wide board should be arranged with small hooks placed at a distance of
ten or twelve inches apart, and on these should hang the enamelled
spoons, strainers, egg-beater, small jugs, and the saucepans, the
bottoms of these being always in evidence and not out of sight in
cupboards. The Europeans have always had their cooking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>utensils
displayed as a part of the kitchen furnishing, and when this is done
there is less temptation to neglect their absolute cleanliness.</p>
<p>One of the comforts of my kitchen is a holder for saucepan covers; I
was about to invent such a holder when I found that the wire ones made
to display half a dozen handsome plates were perfectly suitable. One of
these hangs beside the stove and the covers are conveniently at hand
when required.</p>
<p>A cupboard built in the kitchen, sixteen inches deep and six feet
across, will hold all the casseroles, baking-pans, tins for spices,
etc., which the usual family requires. Mine was built with this
conviction, and if it becomes overcrowded, I know it has things in it
which do not belong there, and a few moments given to overseeing its
rearrangement always leave it with all the space required.</p>
<p>The table shown in the illustration is becoming well-known in
American kitchens; the deep drawers for flour, etc., are a convenience
not easy to estimate, but the fact that two sizes of pastry boards
slide snugly into their places under the top is its best feature.</p>
<p>A ball of string in a holder hung up with small scissors attached, a
neat calendar, a washable tablet for orders, a burnt-match holder, a
match-box holder fastened near the stove, a small mirror on a door or
in an inconspicuous corner, and a wall clock are things which I advise
the young housekeeper to see securely placed in her kitchen before the
pictures are hung in the drawing-room.</p>
<div class="figure plate3width"><img src="images/plate3.jpg" alt=""
width="571" height="720"></div>
<p>A plate-rack is not only always quaint and decorative, but is most
useful and labour-saving. A pestle and mortar should be among the
utensils of every kitchen, as well as a vegetable mill, and a small
hard-wood board, used <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>exclusively for the cutting of fruit,
vegetables, etc., which are to be sliced, saves many a cut finger, as
the plate usually used is not the proper shape or texture for such a
slippery process.</p>
<p>A piece of thick glass measuring about 7&times;9 inches, and bound
about the edges with heavy gummed paper or linen, is useful to lay upon
the open pages of the cook-book, and serves the double purpose of
holding it open at the required page and of protecting it from floured
or buttered fingers.</p>
<p>A plentiful supply of the small earthenware dishes, called
casseroles, marmites, ramekins, and gratin dishes, is especially useful
in the Vegetarian&rsquo;s kitchen.</p>
<p>Those building homes should see that the place on which the stove is
to stand is covered with suitable tiling, and this should extend for
two feet or more around the stove. The floor itself is best covered
with linoleum, and if a colour scheme is carried out in this room, as
it may well be in these days of many-coloured enamelled ware, it can be
accented by the linoleum chosen and the kitchen thus made as beautiful
for its purpose as any room in the house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

set in a sunny corner, or bay-window recess of the dining room, and

large dining table, and can be arranged in almost any dining room.</p>
<p>If pictures are hung in this room nothing less appropriate than
those usually chosen as fit subjects for its walls can be imagined.
Engravings showing the gentle deer hunted to his death, with the
dog&rsquo;s fangs already buried in his flesh, stuffed heads of the
same animal, and paintings of dead fish, ducks or grouse, hanging by
their feet, should not give pleasure to or improve the appetites of
humane people. If pictures are used let us have those which depict
life, joy, kindness, and beauty rather than cruelty, bloodshed, and
death.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subject of seasoning is indeed holy ground in
culinary matters, and after much thought and experiment I have decided
that the phrase so deplored by young housekeepers, &ldquo;season to
taste,&rdquo; is after all not the worst one to use. No such inaccurate
directions were to appear in this cook-book when planned, but I have
finally decided with the army of wiser cooks who have preceded me that
accurate measurements in seasoning are dangerous to success. Not only
do tastes vary, but much depends on the time the seasoning is added, on
the rapidity with which the food is cooking, etc. With this in mind,
and very long prejudice against the old phrase above mentioned, I have
compromised and frequently been tempted to state quantities of salt and
pepper, usually regretting when I have. The truth is, unless one
<i>can</i> &ldquo;season to taste&rdquo; one cannot cook palatable
dishes, and my final word on the subject is that it is well to always
use a little more salt and pepper than seems advisable, and then just
before serving add a little more!</p>

the scales are not the most necessary part of the kitchen furnishing,

<h3 class="main">CANNED GOODS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seems to be a habit with many people to decry the
use of canned vegetables, although I believe there are few households
which subsist without them. My experience is that the best grades of
canned vegetables are often far sweeter and better, fresher in fact,
than vegetables that can be bought in city markets. The housekeeper
should make it a point to know which brands she prefers and to trade
where she can get them; and where no retailer carries them she can
usually obtain cases containing two dozen each from the preservers
themselves. A little trouble taken in the autumn to stock the
store-room, instead of ordering &ldquo;a can of peas&rdquo; now and
then at random, saves time and trouble in the end. Among the canned
vegetables which are put up and sealed the day they are picked by the
best firms are beets, peas, corn, spinach, hard-shelled beans,
tomatoes, stringless beans, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href=
"#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>wax beans, mushrooms, pimentos, okra,
okra-tomato, asparagus, etc.; and the saving of time and labour in the
preparation of beans, spinach, and beets especially, is worth
consideration. People make the mistake of merely warming up canned
goods and then serving them, whereas when the can is opened the
vegetables are only ready to be seasoned and finished as they would be
had they been boiled at home. Good canned vegetables are not easy to
improve upon, and I serve them constantly to people who will not easily
credit my statement that they are not so-called &ldquo;fresh&rdquo;
vegetables. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=

<h3 class="main">CLEAR BOUILLON OR CONSOMM&Eacute;</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are various vegetable extracts in the market
which, when diluted, make delicious stock, or clear soup. If these are
not available, a clear vegetable broth may be made as follows:</p>
<p>Wash 3 cups of any dried beans or lentils, and put them to soak in a
covered earthenware dish with 10 cups of water for twelve hours or so.
Then empty with that same water into a kettle, and let come slowly to
the boiling point, skim frequently, and do not let it actually boil.
When clear, and there seems no further need of skimming, add 1 cup each
of cut onions, carrots, turnips, 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 tablespoon
of salt, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of thyme, etc., 1 tablespoon
of celery seed, and 1 bay leaf.</p>
<p>Let boil up once, and then place on the back of the stove to barely
simmer for two hours; then strain through a fine sieve, and a good
broth is made. The beans, etc., can be utilised in a deep pie, or with
brown or white sauce in crust cups, in a curry, or many other ways.</p>
<p>To make this into a strong, clear soup put 2 tablespoons of butter
in a saucepan, and when melted add &frac12; cup each of chopped onions,
carrots, turnips, and celery, 2 cloves, and a bit of parsley; fry until
somewhat browned, then cover with 6 cups of the broth, and let simmer
very quietly for two hours. Skim often, drain, let cool, remove
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=

when cold, the slightly beaten yolk of 1 egg and the whites of 3, then
set over a hot fire and stir vigorously, watching for the first sign of
boiling. At this, remove to a place where it cannot even simmer, but
will be warm for half an hour, and strain through a fine, clean cloth.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The globe artichoke is a most delicious addition to a
vegetarian menu, and it is not because it is not known to be edible,
but because many people do not know how either to eat it or to serve
it, that it is not oftener seen in America. I have had it served to me
in almost every European country and often in restaurants in America,
and have never encountered but one cook who knew how it should be sent
to the table after cooking, and one waiter who knew how to serve it
when it got there. It is usually served half cold with the leaves
falling all about it because the &ldquo;thistle,&rdquo; and usually the
best of the artichoke besides, has been carelessly removed in the
kitchen; instead of which it should be served whole, as in this way
only can it be kept hot enough to be palatable. The artichoke
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>should be set stem end downward on a hot, flat
dish and wound about at the base with a small table napkin, and the
person who serves it, holding it in the napkin, should reverse it and
taking a small, sharp, silvered knife should cut through the artichoke
on the bottom, using a sawing motion, and with the help of a serving
fork ease apart the &ldquo;thistle&rdquo; and the closely knitted small
leaves in the centre. Unless the artichokes are very large ones, a half
of one is not too much to serve each person. The &ldquo;thistle&rdquo;
should be removed by the server, and this should be done by carefully
separating it from the &ldquo;fond&rdquo; or base, which is the fleshy
part from which the leaves grow out. The leaves should be taken one by
one, by the dry tip, in the fingers, and the fleshy end thus pulled
from the base should be dipped in the sauce served, and the soft
portion removed by drawing it between the front teeth; when the leaves
are finished the base should be cut up with a fork and eaten with the
sauce.</p>

small rootlets are not broken or the skin of the beet bruised, as
anything which causes the juice to escape injures both the taste and
the colour. In the city, beets are seldom obtainable which require less
than two or three hours&rsquo; cooking; but really young, small beets
should not require more than one hour&rsquo;s boiling. When boiled they
should be drained, then plunged into cold water, after which the skin
can be rubbed off with the hand. Some, however, prefer that beets
should be baked or steamed; the time required to cook will then be
somewhat longer. Canned beets are a great convenience.</p>

<p class="first">Mushrooms should only be used when perfectly fresh and
firm; in peeling them take a small knife, and, holding the delicate
fringe at the edge of the mushroom between the edge of the knife and
the thumb, peel the paper-like skin off, pulling it toward the centre
of the mushroom. The stems should be cut or broken off without breaking
the cup, and if sound should be scraped and used. When the mushrooms
are white and small and freshly picked they can be quickly washed and
used without peeling.</p>

those who do not have potatoes served on the table which are white and
floury and thoroughly cooked through, to see that one of the
above-mentioned ways of cooking potatoes is carried out in their
kitchens. Potatoes put in boiling water, or put in a covered steamer
over rapidly boiling water, will cook in from twenty minutes to half an
hour, the time depending, of course, upon the size and age of the
potatoes; they should always be carefully scrubbed and cooked in their
skins, and peeled afterwards.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Spinach should be well picked over, leaf by leaf, and
washed in several different waters, and changed to a different pan each
time it is washed, that the sand may be left behind with each washing.
Then put it in a large kettle, with a scant cup of water for a peck of
spinach, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>let it cook over a slow fire until tender; in
this way its own juices will be extracted, and it will be more tasty
than if cooked in water. It should be then drained and chopped
extremely fine, or until as nearly a pulp as possible, and then mashed
in a mortar or with a potato-masher. It is then ready to prepare in any
way desired for the table.</p>
<p>Delicious spinach can be had canned, and if this is used it needs
only to be very finely chopped and mashed, then seasoned, and prepared
in any of the following ways.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Eggs are very palatable when put in boiling water and
cooked for three or three and a half minutes, but some cooks recommend
that &ldquo;boiled eggs&rdquo; should never boil, but instead, be
placed in a large saucepan which is filled with water that has boiled
and just been removed from the fire. The instructions are to cover the
saucepan closely after putting the eggs in the water, and let it stand
on the back of the stove, the eggs to be removed in ten minutes if
wanted soft, and in twenty minutes if liked well set. Hard-boiled eggs
are certainly more palatable cooked in this way than when boiled for
ten minutes in the ordinary way.</p>

melted break an egg into a saucer, and slide it carefully into the hot
butter, and let it fry until the white is thoroughly set, cooking as
many as are required, separately, in the same way. If a tight cover is
put over the frying pan when the egg is put in, the yolk of the egg
will be as pink as a nicely poached egg when done. Season with pepper
and salt before serving. A little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup
heated in the pan and poured over fried eggs adds variety. <span class=

cook until the whites are firmly set. If the water is shallow the eggs
will spread and be more flat, in which case the boiling water must be
dipped up over the yolks with a spoon to make them pink; if the water
is deep the eggs will be more round than flat. When the eggs are done
lift them carefully from the water with a perforated strainer in order
to drain off the water thoroughly, and serve them on hot toast.</p>

<p class="first">There is no end to the combinations of vegetables for
salads; the few here given are the best ones I have tried. The dressing
should never be put on a fresh green salad until just as it is to be

standing. Lettuce for salads should be carefully looked over; and
clean, inner leaves not washed unless they are muddy; but all the
leaves used which are washed should be thoroughly dried before adding
the dressing. In France the salad basket is one of the most used
kitchen utensils, and the salad leaves after washing are shaken in this
until absolutely dry. The dressing should be very well mixed with the
vegetables, and a little dry salt and pepper added as the salad is
served.</p>

<p class="first">An absolute rule for making good salad dressing is an
almost impossible thing, as this seems to be the one place in cookery
where it is not only allowable but commendable to &ldquo;guess&rdquo;
at proper proportions. The following is as nearly accurate as it seems
well to be. Put 1 scant teaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of black
pepper in a bowl, and stir into them with a wooden fork, very slowly, 3
or 4 tablespoons of fresh oil, and then add half as much or less
vinegar, mixing it well with the oil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

actually drop by drop, from 1 scant cup of cool olive oil, and do this
until the eggs are so thickened that it is not possible to make them
more so; then the remaining oil may be added less slowly. If this first
process is not properly done, no amount of stirring will ever thicken
the sauce. A fork or whisk may be used to finish the stirring. When the
oil is added, beat in slowly 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and 1 of lemon
juice, and &frac12; saltspoon of cayenne pepper. Put on the ice until
wanted.</p>

<p class="first">Use large dinner plates, and on each arrange 6 of the
large light green leaves from the inner part of head lettuce, putting 5
of them with the stalk-end toward the centre of the plate, and another
small one in the centre. Fill the centre leaf with radishes (cut like
roses) and olives, and fill the others as follows: In one put 2
tablespoons of canned green beans, well mixed, before putting on the
leaf, with a little grated onion and French dressing, on the second put
3 or 4 slices of tomato and 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise, on the third
arrange 3 stalks of canned asparagus (white preferred) dipped in French
dressing and sprinkled with chopped chives, on the fourth put 2
half-lengths of a quartered cucumber to be dipped in salt in eating,
and on the fifth put 1 tablespoon of tiny German pearl onions, 2
pickled walnuts, and 2 gherkins. Serve nut or plain bread, or creamed
cheese sandwiches, or all three. This supper may be varied in many
ways; one is to use potato salad or beet and egg instead of the beans.
This as it stands was the result of an emergency when six persons were
suddenly to be served to a late supper and no preparation made. A
well-stocked store-room of preserved goods and a small kitchen garden
filled the need. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"

tissue paper in each, fill this with rice to protect the inside from
too much heat and to keep flat on the bottom, and bake in a rather slow
oven. Do not turn out until cooled, and do not fill until wanted.</p>

<p class="first">Take 2 tablespoons of butter and sift onto them
lightly 2 cups of flour in which 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder is
mixed, and with freshly washed, cool hands mix the flour and butter
thoroughly together, then pour on slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon,
1 cup of milk; with most flours this cup of milk or a very little less
will make the biscuit dough of the proper consistency, but if too thin
or too thick, judgment must be used, as the dough should be so that
with well-floured hands it can scarcely be handled, but can with rapid
motions be made into a roll which will keep its shape when put on a
well-floured bread board. It should then be rolled lightly with a
roller to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and with a
biscuit cutter, the edge of which should be dipped in flour before
using, cut the rounds quickly out and place them at once in a shallow
buttered pan and set in the oven. They should be properly cooked in
eighteen or twenty minutes. The smallest sized baking powder tin is
exactly the right size for a biscuit cutter.</p>
<p>This same recipe makes dumplings, strawberry short-cake, and the top
of vegetable pies.</p>
