<pb id="pb11" n="11"/></p></div1><div1 id="intro" type="Introduction"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The arranging of this help for those who are seeking to obey the call to a higher humanitarianism, which is put forth by non-flesh-eating men and women, has been a labour of love: the labour, the result of an earnest endeavour to so write the receipts that &#8220;the way-faring woman may not err therein,&#8221; the love, of a kind whose integrity may not be questioned, since it has inspired to the never easy task of going against the stream of habit and custom, and to individual effort in behalf of the myriads of gentle and amenable creatures, which an animality that defiles the use of the word has accustomed man to killing and eating.
</p><p>The name Vegetarian has come to mean one who abstains from animal flesh as food; and, as some designation is necessary, it is perhaps a sufficiently suitable one. This term did not, however, originally classify those who used a bloodless diet, but is derived from the Latin <hi>Homo Vegitus</hi>, which words described to the Romans a strong, vigorous man. The definition of the word <hi>Vegitus</hi>, as given in Thomas Holyoke&#8217;s Latin Dictionary, is &#8220;whole, sound, quick, fresh, lively, lusty, gallant, trim, brave,&#8221; and of <hi>Vegito</hi>, &#8220;to refresh, to re-create.&#8221; Professor Mayor of England adds to these definitions: &#8220;The word vegetarian belongs to an illustrious family; <hi>vegetable</hi>, which has been called its mother, is really its niece.&#8221;
<pb id="pb12" n="12"/></p><p>The word has unfortunately become intermingled with various dietetic theories, but the Vegetarian who is one because his conscience for one reason or another condemns the eating of flesh, occupies a very different place in the world of ethics from one who is simply refraining from meat eating in an effort to cure bodily ills.
</p><p>Indeed, the dyspeptic frequenting the usual Vegetarian restaurant has little opportunity to know much about vegetables as food, the menu being, as a rule, so crowded with various mixtures which are supposedly &#8220;meat substitutes&#8221; that vegetables pure and simple find small place. This book contains no meat substitutes, as such, but receipts for the palatable preparation of what is called by many &#8220;live foods,&#8221;&#8212;that is, food which has no blood to shed and does not, therefore, become dead before it can be eaten.
</p><p>There will also be found lacking from the index such dishes as &#8220;Vegetarian Hamburg Steak,&#8221; &#8220;Pigeon Pie, Vegetarian style,&#8221; etc., which should repel rather than attract, by bringing to mind what Bernard Shaw has graphically spoken of as &#8220;scorched carcasses.&#8221;
</p><p>It has been proven by myself and my household that flesh eating may be safely stopped in one day with no injury to health or strength, and that a table supplied from the receipts in this book can make those whom it furnishes with food well and strong as far as food can make them so.
</p><p>There are many reasons why thoughtful, cleanly, humane people should not feed upon animals, but there is a surprising deafness to this fact shown by the majority of those active in humane charities. One marvels to see hundreds of consecrated workers in session, putting forth every effort for the enacting of laws for the <pb id="pb13" n="13"/>amelioration of the sufferings of cattle travelling to slaughter by car and ship, who are still content to patronise the butcher shop to buy food supplied by the dead bodies of these tortured victims of a false appetite. Mere thoughtlessness can make the kindest act cruelly inconsistent, for I once saw a woman presiding at a meeting held to discountenance the wearing of aigrettes with a sheaf of them decorating her bonnet. This looks much like receiving stolen goods while denouncing theft.
</p><p>It is well to write, and legislate, and pray for better and kinder treatment of these frightened, thirst-maddened, tortured creatures on their journey to our tables, but the surest, quickest way to help (and this can be done even while continuing to work for the alleviation of their sufferings) is to stop feeding upon them.
</p><p>In a recent issue of a paper devoted to humane matters there is an indignant protest against the sufferings endured by crated chickens in a certain market, and another article deplores the cruelty shown to turtles in the same place, but when we know the writers of these protests to be still willing to use these creatures on their tables, it is not always easy to fully credit their tender-heartedness. In another such paper there appear from year to year sentimental pictures and poems extolling the kindliness and virtues of &#8220;the cattle upon a thousand hills,&#8221; while those same pages print instructions on the most humane way of slaying them, giving as a reason for the sudden and painless death described that suffering &#8220;poisons the meat.&#8221;
</p><p>The favourite phrase, &#8220;our four-footed friends,&#8221; seems rather an anachronism in the face of our acknowledged relations to them as eater and eaten, for the phrase indicates a mutual pact of friendship, which, however well <pb id="pb14" n="14"/>sustained by them, is dishonoured by man; for even cannibals, we are told, sink no lower than to eat their foes.
</p><p>The demand for butcher&#8217;s meat may not seem materially lessened because I do not eat it, but it is lessened notwithstanding, and I rejoice to know that in the past seven years my abstinence from flesh must have resulted in a little less slaughter, and I am glad to have reduced by even one drop the depth of that ocean of blood. I have heard the Biblical statement that man was to have dominion over all the earth quoted as a justification for the eating of the lower animals. We will some day be so civilised that we will recognise the great truth that dominion implies care, and guardianship, and protection rather than the right to destroy.
</p><p>The first objection voiced against Vegetarianism is not usually against its principle, but its practice; we are told that the refusal to eat meat causes inconvenience, and that it is best to &#8220;eat what is set before you, asking no questions for conscience&#8217;s sake.&#8221; I could respect the position of one who literally believed and consistently acted on this mandate, but where in Christendom can he be found? Few of us could or would eat the flesh of a pet lamb, or partake knowingly of horse flesh, or could or would feel called upon to dine on these lines with the peoples who eat dog, or with so-called cannibals. The host might have secured, in a broad spirit of hospitality, just the particular carcass which most pleased his own palate, but courtesy seldom forces us to eat any flesh other than the sorts to which our own habits have accustomed us.
</p><p>There is a well-known story of an American statesman who was reared by Vegetarian parents in the country, and taken while still a small boy to dine at a neighbour&#8217;s. During the progress of the meal a large platter was borne <pb id="pb15" n="15"/>into the room, on which lay something the like of which he had not seen on any table. He stared in wonder, and finally located the resemblance and shouted, &#8220;Why, mother, if that isn&#8217;t a dead hen!&#8221; Habit had not overcome his horror of that particular dead thing as food, as it would have done had he seen dead hens served as food all his life.
</p><p>As to the inconvenience caused my friends when I am at their tables, I consider it of such small consequence compared to the fact that even one child should be standing almost knee-deep in blood in some slaughter-house, working to supply my wants, that it is not worth a second thought. No one need go hungry from any well-planned dinner, even though no extra preparation has been made for the non-meat-eating guest; but if my hostess knows in advance that I do not eat meat, and wishes to have prepared an especial dish, I give her the benefit of the doubt, and believe that she is as pleased to do it as I would be in her place. We like to take a little extra trouble to entertain our friends, and the thought expended to give others pleasure is perhaps the real joy of hospitality.
</p><p>Another class of objector likes to remind us that we take life when we eat vegetables, or drink, or breathe. A friend, who has since ceased to consider the unnecessary and cruel slaughtering of thousands of creatures daily a fit subject for joking, once sent me in raillery a sonnet which rehearsed the sad death suffered by a cabbage to satisfy a Vegetarian&#8217;s selfish cravings. I find no qualms in my own conscience on this subject, but should I ever come to feel as these over-sensitive claim I should, I hope I will not then eat even the &#8220;innocent cabbage.&#8221;
</p><p>Again, if the germs in the water we drink and the air we breathe do die by reason of our drinking and breathing <pb id="pb16" n="16"/>I endure no self-condemnation. Man cannot be required to do the impossible by any Principle of Good, and to do each day what good he is able to do, to avoid the evil he can avoid, and in every difficulty choose what he thinks to be the lesser of two evils, is perhaps as much as even Divine Love expects of him to-day.
</p><p>It is well to face the unpleasant fact that there are occasions when in our present state of development it seems necessary to kill in self-defence, as it were, moths, rats, etc.; but even in this we can &#8220;do our best,&#8221; and it has been well said, &#8220;angels can do no more.&#8221; We can by care in our households greatly reduce this necessity, and we can always see that no creatures, although destroying our property, pilfering or stealing, are in their death made to suffer. In this connection I would urge every one who reads these lines to never permit a piece of sticky fly-paper to be brought into the house, for of all cruel ways of destruction, this slow method, by which the unfortunate fly almost dismembers itself in its frantic efforts to escape, is one of the most fiendishly contrived.
</p><p>An advocate of Vegetarianism has truly said, &#8220;A vegetable diet is as little connected with weakness and cowardice as meat eating is with physical force and courage.&#8221; That Vegetarians are not physical weaklings is no mere matter of opinion, but is proven by the giant Japanese wrestlers; the ancient Greek wrestlers; those Indian regiments of the British army showing most endurance; by the peasantry of the world, which is seldom able to afford meat, and above all, by those famous Vegetarians who march around the globe doing the work carnivorous man is too weak to do,&#8212;the horse, the ox, the camel, and the elephant. One of our best-known cooking teachers and food experts printed this statement not long ago: <pb id="pb17" n="17"/>&#8220;While meat seems necessary to the rapid development of the American, I must contend that a well-selected vegetable diet will give greater health, bodily vigour, and mental strength,&#8221; which would seem contradictory, for even an American would not seem to require other food than that which will give him greatest health, bodily vigour, and mental strength.
</p><p>Nor have we cause to feel ashamed of the mentality of the guests at Ceres&#8217; table, which is graced by a goodly company; the list of names encircling the cover of &#8220;The Vegetarian Magazine&#8221; reads, &#8220;Adam, Hesiod, Gautama, Isaiah, Daniel, Plato, Zoroaster, Aristotle, Seneca, Ovid, Plutarch, Pope, Swedenborg, Leonardo da Vinci, Voltaire, Franklin, Westley, Linn&#230;us, Shelley, Tolstoi, and King Oscar II.&#8221; Others are Bernard Shaw, and Maurice Maeterlinck (who is said to have become a non-meat eater to gain greater endurance for his favourite pastime of mountain climbing), Richard Wagner, and General Booth.
</p><p>But after all, the one great argument for a fleshless diet is the humanitarian one, and it does not seem possible that persons exist to-day who do not know of the horrors of cruelty which take place hourly, in order that meat may be eaten by men and women who could not look without sickening at the process which has made possible the roast upon their tables, but who are nevertheless the employers of every fainting child in the stock-yards, and every brutalised man in the shambles, whose wages they pay with every pound of meat they buy. The real butcher of an animal is the one for whom it receives its death blow, not the one who actually deals that blow.
</p><p>A man who recently visited some stock-yards writes: &#8220;We were sorry to see the <hi>Thor</hi> man make mislicks at a <pb id="pb18" n="18"/>pretty heifer. His first stroke did not fell her, and she staggered and looked at him so wonderingly and pathetically. He could not strike her while her head was in that position, and after giving her two or three more ineffectual blows, she looked at him so reproachfully, as if pleading, &#8216;Why do you treat me so cruelly?  What have I ever done to you?&#8217; Finally he got her down and out of her misery. I shall never take a bit of steak on my fork without seeing that pretty heifer lifting her stunned head to that awkward pounder.&#8221;
</p><p>Perhaps nothing more revolting than this same writer&#8217;s remarks anent pig-killing has been written, but since the words are accurately true, they should be fit to read, for if the <hi>words</hi> which tell the truth about meat as food are unfit for our ears, the <hi>meat</hi> itself is not fit for our mouths. He describes the pig-sticking, the skinning, and the process which makes the pig into pork, and then adds: &#8220;He goes into the cooling room, and the whole effort from that time is to keep him from crumbling back into dust, attacked by worms. Salt and brine and smoke and cold prevent the corpse from utter dissolution. The refrigerator is a sort of Purgatory where the brute stays until he finally finds a cemetery in the human alimentary canal.&#8221; Yet this man expects to again have meat &#8220;on his fork&#8221;!
</p><p>The &#8220;Cosmopolitan&#8221; calls attention to the remarkable procession daily passing through a certain slaughter-house, as follows: &#8220;Imagine a procession of 10,000 cattle marching two by two, in a line fifteen miles long; let 20,000 sheep follow them, bleating along twelve miles of road; after them drive sixteen miles of hogs, 27,000 strong; then let 30,000 fowls bring up the rear, clucking and quacking and gobbling, over a space of six miles; and in this whole caravan, stretching for nearly fifty miles and requiring <pb id="pb19" n="19"/>two days to pass a given point, you will see the animals devoted to death in the packing houses of &#8212;&#8212; &amp; Co. in a single day. Surely a Buddhist would think that the head of that establishment had much to answer for. Never before in the world&#8217;s history was a massacre of the innocents organised on such a stupendous scale or with such scientific system.&#8221;
</p><p>People are <corr sic="suprisingly">surprisingly</corr> callous to the sufferings of those animals destined to become food. Recently some well-dressed, well-mannered men were on a train returning East from a Western visit, and the train coming to a standstill for some reason, their conversation was plainly overheard by their fellow-passengers. They were discussing a visit to the stock-yards, and one of them, quite convulsed with laughter, cried out that he really thought the most comical sight he had seen while away, in fact one of the funniest things he had seen in his whole life, was the antics of a pig &#8220;which had escaped out of the scalding pen!&#8221; The pig-sticker had evidently been as awkward that time as the man who missed the pretty heifer.
</p><p>It is daily less possible to buy turkeys and chickens minus their heads. The delicate death without the use of the old-time axe (which we degraded men and women have thought a pretty symbol to place on Thanksgiving Day table cards) is brought about by hanging the fowls up by the feet, in what fright can be imagined, an incision is then made in the roof of the mouth, and after bleeding to death, which, as in the case of calves or veal, insures solid white flesh, they are served as food to dainty women who can scarcely bear to kill a fly, and alas! to some members of the societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!
</p><p>One crate of chickens can encase more suffering than I <pb id="pb20" n="20"/>want endured for me. There is first the terror in capture, then the suffering of being thrust, legs often tied, in the small over-crowded crate, then the journey in the shrieking train, and the thirst-tortured hours in the sun before the final twist of the neck or the blow of the axe, given in many cases just before natural death would render the fowl unfit for sale. And such food, poisoned by fear and suffering, is considered the most delicate, and thought fit to feed to invalids!
</p><p>That all chickens do not endure the same suffering before death is no excuse for eating them, for some will have to submit to it while chicken is an article of food. The modern invention of fattening fowl by the machine-stuffing method, to make what are called in England &#8220;Surrey fowls,&#8221; and in America are given various fancy names, is so revolting that it almost makes one faint to read a true account of it. We are selfishly prone to comfort ourselves when these things are brought to our notice with the thought that the lower creatures do not suffer as we would. The fact is that no two live beings suffer the same in any event, physical or mental, but the lower animal or bird or fish suffers in its fear and death all it is capable of suffering, and we have no right to make any creature do this for our pleasure.
</p><p>Mr. E. Bell has written, &#8220;Dreadful are the revelations made by humane men, who, setting aside personal comfort and peace of mind, have endeavoured to sound the depths of animal agony and bloodshed. The process of flaying alive, and even of dismembering animals before the breath has left their bodies, is far from uncommon in private slaughter-houses.&#8221;
</p><p>When we witness the cruelty to horses on our streets, though they are property which the most unwise would <pb id="pb21" n="21"/>naturally seek to care for, we can only imagine what must chance to the unfortunate creatures, already condemned to death and only regarded as food, at the hands of the hardened men whose miserable lot it is to be employed by Christendom to do its most evil work.
</p><p>In a pamphlet called &#8220;An Epitome of Vegetarianism&#8221; C. P. Newcombe writes: &#8220;Our opponents are quick to point out the supposed resemblance between the canine teeth of man and those of the carnivora, forgetting that they are even more prominent in the ape, the horse, and the camel. We accept the challenge and appeal for an authoritative statement of the facts to the great masters of science, among whom there is complete agreement, viz., that expressed by Baron Cuvier, the Professor of Natural History in the College of France, who wrote in &#8216;The Animal Kingdom,&#8217; vol. i, page 88: &#8216;Fruits, roots, and the other succulent parts of vegetables appear to be the natural food of man; his hands afford him a facility for gathering them, and his short and comparatively weak jaws, his short canine teeth, not passing beyond the common line of others, and his tuberculous cheek teeth would not permit him either to feed upon herbage or devour flesh unless these aliments were previously prepared by the culinary process.&#8217; Similar opinions are expressed by Sir Charles Bell, F. R. S., Prof. William Lawrence, F. R. S., Sir Richard Owen, K. C. B., F. R. S., and Dr. Charles Darwin, with many others.&#8221;
</p><p>While interesting in stating a case, this interests me as an argument but little, for if we were carnivorously made, with our minds, our hearts, our capacity for love and charity, and that great hope we have of finally manifesting the perfection of the sons of God, we still should control our tendencies by a higher law, and no more be carnivorous <pb id="pb22" n="22"/>than we are apes, or marauders, or any other mental or physical manifestation from which spiritual evolution has lifted us high.
</p><p>But this humanitarianism does not consider alone the animals slaughtered, but the men, women, and children who do this revolting work. One packing-house in the West advertises over 18,000 employees; multiply this by thousands and one can estimate the numbers of human beings who are thus degraded and brutalised. In my own household I have made it a point of honour to demand no labour which I would not be willing to do myself; I might fail in strength, but morally I would be willing to undertake any work required by me, and from the day I realised what I required from others if I ate meat, I became an abstainer from it, for no surer ethical truth can be stated than that we have no moral right to demand from the hands of another, work we would not be willing to undertake ourselves.
</p><p>Mr. Henry Salt has written, &#8220;Of all recognised occupations, the work which is looked upon with the greatest loathing (next to the hangman&#8217;s) is that of the butcher&#8212;the trade of doing to death countless numbers of inoffensive and highly organised creatures, amid scenes of indescribable filth and ferocity&#8212;is delegated to a pariah class of slaughter-men, who are thus themselves made the victims of a grievous social wrong.&#8221;
</p><p>So large a percentage of the murderers of to-day have been butchers, they or their fathers before them, that these statistics alone constitute a sufficient argument for Vegetarianism.
</p><p>Man&#8217;s inhumanity to himself in this matter of flesh eating is rapidly being uncovered by meat inspectors, food experts, and hundreds of physicians the world over. <pb id="pb23" n="23"/>The statistics comparing meat-eating and non-meat-eating races with regard to tuberculosis, cancer, appendicitis, etc., are of the greatest interest to those who care not only for the health but for the mere cleanness of their bodies.
</p><p>Dr. B. W. Richardson, in a book called &#8220;The Field of Disease,&#8221; says: &#8220;In Jewish communities there are a number of men set apart to act as inspectors of animal food. They attend at the slaughter-houses, and after an animal is slain and dressed they submit it to inspection; then, unless they put upon it their sign, that it is free from disease, it is not permitted to enter a Jewish family. It enters into the families outside the Jewish community, so that we who are not Jews actually accept into our bodies food which the Jews have rejected as diseased.&#8221;
</p><p>The statistics taken from two small abattoirs alone, for one year, as given by a secretary of one Jewish ecclesiastical board are as follows:

</p><p>According to this very nearly one-third of all the meat sold to Christian families is tainted by parasitical disease. If an animal dies of cancer, tuberculosis, etc., our laws protect us from the carcass, but, if slaughtered, the diseased portion is cut away and the remainder is sold as fit for food. <hi>Such</hi> blood is squeezed from beef and poured by the gallon by loving hands into the willing lips of consumptives and an&#230;mics!
<pb id="pb24" n="24"/></p><p>The true Vegetarian will not be seen adorned (?) by any of the reapings from a dead body, whether they be feathers or furs, for these have no beauty in the sight of those who see them in thought, dripping with the blood from which they can never be truly cleansed.
</p><p>Those who would &#8220;strain at gnats&#8221; while swallowing camels, criticise the Vegetarian for his kid gloves and his leather shoes; but perfect conditions do not yet prevail for the absolutely consistent carrying out of his principles; his effort is to help to bring these to pass, and he does not refrain from beginning for the reason that he cannot yet do all. An adequate substitute for leather has been made which experiments have proven of value, but, as yet, there is no demand which justifies its manufacture.
</p><p>Many express the fear that, were wholesale slaughter abolished, the earth would be overrun by the lower animals; but were artificial and unnatural breeding discontinued we can safely trust that the animal creation would find its proper place in the world, as everything does, under the guidance of the controlling Mind which is Creator.
</p><p>Stop and think for a moment what the world would be like to-day if it were Vegetarian. If the world were Vegetarian, the endless caravans of doomed creatures would not be ambling to the shambles; not a man would be brutalised by the daily slaughter of hundreds of gentle creatures; not a woman would be engaged in sorting edible parts from the dissected carcasses, making all red around her; not a child would be standing deep in offal, seeking useful bits of dead bodies; &#8220;where sympathy is, cruelty is impossible,&#8221; therefore, not a dog would be maltreated, not a cat selfishly deserted to starve, not a horse cruelly beaten, and not a vivisectionist could <pb id="pb25" n="25"/>be found on the face of the earth! Those who had learned to be just to the lower animals would not fail in their duties to man, and in this millennium, prophesied in <xref url="bib:isa 11:9">Isaiah xi: 9</xref>, slaughter-houses, transport cars, and cattle-ships would be empty, and the fields and meadows would be filled with labourers under the clear sky, tilling the ground to provide the food of man.

<pb id="pb29" n="29"/></p></div1></front><body><div1 id="ch1" type="Chapter"><head>THE KITCHEN</head><p>There is no room in the house which requires such careful furnishing as the kitchen, and much time may be saved there if the right thing is in the right place, for just as truly as &#8220;the means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done,&#8221; do the means to do things well tend toward their being done.
</p><p>To house-builders I would urge that it pays to have a white enamelled sink, and to insist that no sand-soap or scouring soap be used on it, as this removes the finish and makes it less easy to keep it spotless. See that a package of one of the cleaning powders is placed near the sink, convenient for use the first time the maid looks about for materials, and over the sink on small hooks have hung two or three different shaped sink brushes. An enamelled soap-dish should be fastened above the sink, and on the left of it a grooved, slightly slanting draining board for washed dishes; hanging under this on a large hook should be the enamelled dishpan and back of it a wire drainer, both hanging free from the wall.
</p><p>Any kitchen can have a chair-rail put around it, and this four-inch wide board should be arranged with small hooks placed at a distance of ten or twelve inches apart, and on these should hang the enamelled spoons, strainers, egg-beater, small jugs, and the saucepans, the bottoms of these being always in evidence and not out of sight in cupboards. The Europeans have always had their cooking <pb id="pb30" n="30"/>utensils displayed as a part of the kitchen furnishing, and when this is done there is less temptation to neglect their absolute cleanliness.
</p><p>One of the comforts of my kitchen is a holder for saucepan covers; I was about to invent such a holder when I found that the wire ones made to display half a dozen handsome plates were perfectly suitable. One of these hangs beside the stove and the covers are conveniently at hand when required.
</p><p>A cupboard built in the kitchen, sixteen inches deep and six feet across, will hold all the casseroles, baking-pans, tins for spices, etc., which the usual family requires. Mine was built with this conviction, and if it becomes overcrowded, I know it has things in it which do not belong there, and a few moments given to overseeing its rearrangement always leave it with all the space required.
</p><p>The table shown in the illustration is becoming well-known in American kitchens; the deep drawers for flour, etc., are a convenience not easy to estimate, but the fact that two sizes of pastry boards slide snugly into their places under the top is its best feature.
</p><p>A ball of string in a holder hung up with small scissors attached, a neat calendar, a washable tablet for orders, a burnt-match holder, a match-box holder fastened near the stove, a small mirror on a door or in an inconspicuous corner, and a wall clock are things which I advise the young housekeeper to see securely placed in her kitchen before the pictures are hung in the drawing-room.

</p><p><figure id="plate3"/>

</p><p>A plate-rack is not only always quaint and decorative, but is most useful and labour-saving. A pestle and mortar should be among the utensils of every kitchen, as well as a vegetable mill, and a small hard-wood board, used <pb id="pb31" n="31"/>exclusively for the cutting of fruit, vegetables, etc., which are to be sliced, saves many a cut finger, as the plate usually used is not the proper shape or texture for such a slippery process.
</p><p>A piece of thick glass measuring about 7&#215;9 inches, and bound about the edges with heavy gummed paper or linen, is useful to lay upon the open pages of the cook-book, and serves the double purpose of holding it open at the required page and of protecting it from floured or buttered fingers.
</p><p>A plentiful supply of the small earthenware dishes, called casseroles, marmites, ramekins, and gratin dishes, is especially useful in the Vegetarian&#8217;s kitchen.
</p><p>Those building homes should see that the place on which the stove is to stand is covered with suitable tiling, and this should extend for two feet or more around the stove. The floor itself is best covered with linoleum, and if a colour scheme is carried out in this room, as it may well be in these days of many-coloured enamelled ware, it can be accented by the linoleum chosen and the kitchen thus made as beautiful for its purpose as any room in the house.

</p><p>If pictures are hung in this room nothing less appropriate than those usually chosen as fit subjects for its walls can be imagined. Engravings showing the gentle deer hunted to his death, with the dog&#8217;s fangs already buried in his flesh, stuffed heads of the same animal, and paintings of dead fish, ducks or grouse, hanging by their feet, should not give pleasure to or improve the appetites of humane people. If pictures are used let us have those which depict life, joy, kindness, and beauty rather than cruelty, bloodshed, and death.

<pb id="pb39" n="39"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch3" type="Chapter"><head>SUGGESTIVE COMMENTS</head><div2 id="ch3.1" type="Section"><head>SEASONING</head><p>The subject of seasoning is indeed holy ground in culinary matters, and after much thought and experiment I have decided that the phrase so deplored by young housekeepers, &#8220;season to taste,&#8221; is after all not the worst one to use. No such inaccurate directions were to appear in this cook-book when planned, but I have finally decided with the army of wiser cooks who have preceded me that accurate measurements in seasoning are dangerous to success. Not only do tastes vary, but much depends on the time the seasoning is added, on the rapidity with which the food is cooking, etc. With this in mind, and very long prejudice against the old phrase above mentioned, I have compromised and frequently been tempted to state quantities of salt and pepper, usually regretting when I have. The truth is, unless one <hi>can</hi> &#8220;season to taste&#8221; one cannot cook palatable dishes, and my final word on the subject is that it is well to always use a little more salt and pepper than seems advisable, and then just before serving add a little more!

</p></div2><div2 id="ch3.2" type="Section"><head>MEASURING</head><p>Weights as a means of measuring quantities have been avoided in these recipes, as I can see no advantage to the system which uses them, and I have been able to show <pb id="pb40" n="40"/>even English cooks that the scales are not the most necessary part of the kitchen furnishing, and they have become devoted to our simple method of using the kitchen cup as the standard. It holds &#189; pint, and 2 cups, therefore, hold 1 pint; 4 cups hold 1 quart; and I find no fault with the old couplet,&#8212;
</p><lg type="Group"><l>&#8220;A pint&#8217;s a pound
    </l><l>The world around.&#8221;</l></lg><p>It usually is, and one cannot go far wrong in acting as if it always were.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch3.3" type="Section"><head>THICKENING</head><p>In thickening sauces and soups, ordinary flour can always be used and cornstarch also, and as a rule I have said &#8220;flour&#8221; only in these recipes, but have only refrained from always advising potato-flour because it would have confused many who cannot obtain it in America. In Germany it is always used, and when it can be had is far nicer for thickening all vegetable sauces and soups than any other sort of flour.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch3.4" type="Section"><head>AN HERB GARDEN</head><p>No one thing pays better for the little trouble expended than a small herb garden. Buy two or three tarragon plants, cover them in the winter, and in the autumn pick the leaves to make vinegar and to dry. Plant chervil, parsley, thyme, chives, and a plant of rosemary.
</p><p>A window-box will keep parsley and chives on hand, and a clump of chives from the market will grow for weeks if set in a bowl and watered occasionally.

<pb id="pb41" n="41"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch3.5" type="Section"><head>GELATINE</head><p>Instead of the usual gelatine use must be made of arrowroot or a gelatine advertised to be purely vegetable. One tablespoon is usually allowed to 1 pint of liquid, but experiments must be made and there will usually be directions found with the package.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch3.6" type="Section"><head>FAT FOR FRYING</head><p>The Vegetarian can well afford to do away with that doubtful economy, cooking butter. For ordinary frying use good butter; for deep fat use a good brand of cooking-oil, or cocoanut butter.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch3.7" type="Section"><head>CANNED GOODS</head><p>It seems to be a habit with many people to decry the use of canned vegetables, although I believe there are few households which subsist without them. My experience is that the best grades of canned vegetables are often far sweeter and better, fresher in fact, than vegetables that can be bought in city markets. The housekeeper should make it a point to know which brands she prefers and to trade where she can get them; and where no retailer carries them she can usually obtain cases containing two dozen each from the preservers themselves. A little trouble taken in the autumn to stock the store-room, instead of ordering &#8220;a can of peas&#8221; now and then at random, saves time and trouble in the end. Among the canned vegetables which are put up and sealed the day they are picked by the best firms are beets, peas, corn, spinach, hard-shelled beans, tomatoes, stringless beans, <pb id="pb42" n="42"/>wax beans, mushrooms, pimentos, okra, okra-tomato, asparagus, etc.; and the saving of time and labour in the preparation of beans, spinach, and beets especially, is worth consideration. People make the mistake of merely warming up canned goods and then serving them, whereas when the can is opened the vegetables are only ready to be seasoned and finished as they would be had they been boiled at home. Good canned vegetables are not easy to improve upon, and I serve them constantly to people who will not easily credit my statement that they are not so-called &#8220;fresh&#8221; vegetables.

<pb id="pb45" n="45"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch4" type="Chapter"><head>SOUPS</head><p>Most clear soups can be greatly improved in colour by using a small quantity of vegetable soup browning, or caramel. Do not overdo it, however, as the flavour is not pleasant when too pronounced. All cream soups should be cooked in a double boiler.

</p><div2 id="ch4.1" type="Section"><head>VEGETABLE STOCK</head><p>Few meat stocks have of themselves more flavour than vegetable stock, that is, the water in which vegetables have cooked. The water in which rice, onions, leeks, celery, beans, cabbage, etc., have boiled is valuable in Vegetarian cookery, and the wise cook will use it in many ways to enhance the flavours of soups and sauces.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.2" type="Section"><head>A SIMPLE CONSOMM&#201; OR STOCK</head><p>A simple way of preparing a rich, clear consomm&#233; is to wash well &#189; cup of German lentils, drain them and toss them for ten minutes in a saucepan in which 1 tablespoon of butter has been melted. Then pour on them 5 cups of cold water, set them over a hot fire, and let them boil rapidly about half an hour only. Drain, and strain through a fine cloth, and return to a clean saucepan with 1 bay leaf, 1 slice of onion, 2 cloves, and &#189; teaspoon of <pb id="pb46" n="46"/>celery seed; simmer slowly for fifteen minutes, season with salt and pepper, and add a little sherry if liked.
</p><p>If the lentils are cooked longer, it will make a cloudy soup, which will be stronger but not clear.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.3" type="Section"><head>CLEAR BOUILLON OR CONSOMM&#201;</head><p>There are various vegetable extracts in the market which, when diluted, make delicious stock, or clear soup. If these are not available, a clear vegetable broth may be made as follows:
</p><p>Wash 3 cups of any dried beans or lentils, and put them to soak in a covered earthenware dish with 10 cups of water for twelve hours or so. Then empty with that same water into a kettle, and let come slowly to the boiling point, skim frequently, and do not let it actually boil. When clear, and there seems no further need of skimming, add 1 cup each of cut onions, carrots, turnips, 1 tablespoon of parsley, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 clove of garlic, and 1 teaspoon of thyme, etc., 1 tablespoon of celery seed, and 1 bay leaf.
</p><p>Let boil up once, and then place on the back of the stove to barely simmer for two hours; then strain through a fine sieve, and a good broth is made. The beans, etc., can be utilised in a deep pie, or with brown or white sauce in crust cups, in a curry, or many other ways.
</p><p>To make this into a strong, clear soup put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add &#189; cup each of chopped onions, carrots, turnips, and celery, 2 cloves, and a bit of parsley; fry until somewhat browned, then cover with 6 cups of the broth, and let simmer very quietly for two hours. Skim often, drain, let cool, remove <pb id="pb47" n="47"/>any grease from the top, and to clarify add to it, when cold, the slightly beaten yolk of 1 egg and the whites of 3, then set over a hot fire and stir vigorously, watching for the first sign of boiling. At this, remove to a place where it cannot even simmer, but will be warm for half an hour, and strain through a fine, clean cloth. A wineglass of sherry may be added if to be served in cups.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.4" type="Section"><head>CREAM OF ARTICHOKE</head><p>Scrape and slice enough Jerusalem artichokes to make 2 cups, and cover them with cold water. Let them stand for fifteen or twenty minutes, and put them in a saucepan with 2 quarts of cold water or milk, or 1 quart of each, and let them cook for an hour or until thoroughly soft. Now rub them through a sieve with 2 cups of the stock in which they cooked, and return to the fire. When boiling add 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 of flour, rubbed together, and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of pepper, and cook about ten minutes before adding 2 cups of hot milk, or 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of cream. Stir well and let boil up once before serving. A teaspoon of chopped parsley or chives improves the appearance and taste of almost any cream soup.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.5" type="Section"><head>CREAM OF ARTICHOKE WITH NASTURTIUMS</head><p>Make the plain cream of artichoke soup as in preceding recipe, and add before straining 1 handful of nasturtium leaves and blossoms; or, instead, add 1 tablespoon of these, finely minced, to the soup before serving.

<pb id="pb48" n="48"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch4.6" type="Section"><head>ASPARAGUS SOUP</head><p>Use 1 can of asparagus, cut off the tips, and lay them aside. Cut up the stalks, cover with 4 cups of cold milk (or use half water and half milk), and let cook slowly in a double boiler for half an hour; then strain, pressing the asparagus well to extract the flavour. Return to the saucepan, add 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 tablespoon of butter, into which 1 teaspoon of flour has been made smooth, season generously with salt and pepper, add the asparagus tips, 1 cup of milk, and, just before serving, 1 tablespoon of whipped cream. A tablespoon of minced onion fried for ten minutes in butter is sometimes added to the stalks while cooking.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.7" type="Section"><head>BARLEY AND TOMATO SOUP</head><p>Cook 1 can of tomatoes and 1 chopped Spanish onion together for fifteen minutes, then rub through a wire sieve; add 3 tablespoons of pearl barley, 1 tablespoon of butter, some pepper and salt, and cook for one hour, until the barley is soft. Re-season before serving.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.8" type="Section"><head>BLACK BEAN SOUP</head><p>Soak 2 cups of beans for twelve hours or more, and then drain them and put into 8 cups of cold water; add 3 whole cloves, 3 whole allspice, and 3 whole peppers, salt well and boil gently for two hours, rub through sieve, and reheat. Mix 1 tablespoon of thickening flour, and 1 tablespoon of butter and water, and stir into the soup at boiling point; season afresh and pour into a tureen in which are placed, neatly sliced, 1 hard-boiled egg and half <pb id="pb49" n="49"/>a dozen seeded slices of lemon. This soup is improved by adding 1 wineglass of sherry, or one may substitute for it a few drops of Tomato Chutney or Worcestershire sauce.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.9" type="Section"><head>BELGIAN SOUP</head><p>Take 4 cups of diced turnips and put them in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons of butter, and stir for ten minutes over a slow fire; then stir in 2 cups of water, 2 teaspoons of brown sugar, and plenty of pepper and salt, and let simmer for another ten minutes; add 2 cups of milk thickened with 1 tablespoon of flour, let boil up, stirring constantly, and serve with croutons.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.10" type="Section"><head>PLAIN BEAN SOUP</head><p>Wash 2 cups of any sort of dried beans and soak twelve hours or more in cold water. Before using, strain them and cover with 8 cups of cold water. Put over the fire and let cook gently for four hours, then rub them through a sieve into their own stock, season with 1 tablespoon of salt and &#189; teaspoon of pepper and 1 tablespoon of butter, and let them cook ten minutes longer. Serve with half-inch squares of toast in the tureen.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.11" type="Section"><head>BROWN BEAN SOUP</head><p>Take 1 cup of brown beans and &#189; cup of German lentils, wash well and put in a saucepan with plenty of cold water, 2 or 3 chopped onions, 1 stalk of celery, 1 bay leaf, and simmer together for three hours, then strain. If a thin soup is wanted, do not press any of the pulp <pb id="pb50" n="50"/>through the strainer, but if it is liked somewhat thick, do so. Return the strained soup to the saucepan and thicken with 1 teaspoon of thickening flour. This is now delicious soup stock, and can be served plain, or varied by adding peas, diced carrots, spaghetti, a few drops of sauce, a little sherry, tomato catsup, or curry powder. Season well with salt and pepper before serving.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.12" type="Section"><head>RED BEAN SOUP</head><p>Soak for 8 hours or more 2 cups of red beans, then put them in a large saucepan containing 8 cups of cold water, 1 cup of milk, and 2 onions halved, each having 4 cloves stuck in it. Let cook for two hours, then press through a sieve, reheat, adding just before serving 1 wineglass of claret and fresh seasoning of salt and pepper. 1 hard-boiled egg chopped fine is an improvement to this soup.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.13" type="Section"><head>LIMA BEAN CREAM SOUP</head><p>Soak 2 cups of dried lima beans for several hours and then put them in a saucepan with 1 cup of cold water and 1 cup of milk and let them cook for two hours, adding salt when they have partly cooked. Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 1 onion chopped fine. Let cook slowly until browned, then scrape the contents of the frying pan into the saucepan containing the beans, and add 1 tablespoon of tomato catsup or chutney and press all through a sieve, and re-season before serving. If liked a little thick, use 1 tablespoon of flour, made smooth in &#189; cup of milk or cream, to thicken. A tablespoon of whipped cream in the tureen is always an improvement to a cream soup.

<pb id="pb51" n="51"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch4.14" type="Section"><head>DUTCH CABBAGE SOUP</head><p>Make exactly like Cockie-Leekie soup, using the water in which a cabbage has boiled for stock and adding &#189; cup of finely chopped cabbage instead of using any of the barley to return to the strained soup. Those who like caraway seed will enjoy the addition of 1 teaspoon of these to the soup. If used, add them with the chopped cabbage after the other seasoning has been removed.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.15" type="Section"><head>CALCUTTA BISQUE</head><p>Put 1 cup of tomato pulp in a saucepan and with it 1 bay leaf. When hot add to it 1 saltspoon of soda, and as it foams stir slowly into it 3 or 4 cups of milk, 1 teaspoon of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of butter, and 1 saltspoon of salt. Let boil up once and serve with croutons.
</p><p>The water in which rice has boiled or any vegetable stock may be substituted for milk and the soda then omitted.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.16" type="Section"><head>CANTON STEW</head><p>Put 2 cups of finely shredded cabbage in enough water to boil and let cook slowly until tender, which should be in about three quarters of an hour. When the cabbage has been cooking half an hour, add a cup of milk, and when it is nearly done put in 2 cups of milk; let boil up once, then season with salt, black pepper, and pour in a hot tureen, in which should be laid 1 teaspoon of butter. Those who like oyster crackers served in or with milk stews can use them with this soup which greatly resembles an oyster stew in flavour.


<pb id="pb52" n="52"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch4.17" type="Section"><head>CARROT BROTH</head><p>Scrape and cut 3 or 4 large carrots (or more of the small French sort) in eighths lengthwise and boil them until tender. Put 2 tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, and when melted add 1 scant half cup of oatmeal to it, putting in 1 tablespoon at a time and stirring carefully with a wooden spoon until all the butter is taken up; then put in 1 ladle of stock in which the carrots have been cooked, and continue stirring; then another ladle of stock, and so on until a cup and a half of stock has been added during ten minutes&#8217; slow cooking. Now put in another cup of stock and let cook ten minutes; then, as the soup will be getting too thick, add another cup of stock and so on, thinning the soup with additional stock until the oatmeal is thoroughly cooked. If Quaker Oats is used, the soup will only have to cook about forty minutes, and it is best to strain it before serving; fine Scotch meal will take longer, but does not need to be strained and thickens somewhat better.
</p><p>When the soup is half cooked add 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 saltspoon of pepper, and a dash of nutmeg. (Serve the carrots with a plain sauce or warm them up next day in some of the ways mentioned under Carrots.)

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.18" type="Section"><head>CREAM OF CARROT AND ONION</head><p>Take 2 cups of grated carrot and 1 chopped onion and fry for ten minutes with 1 tablespoon of butter and then cover with 4 cups of cold water and let boil.

Let cook for an hour, then add &#189; cup of stale bread crumbs and 2 cups of water, and let cook half an hour longer. Rub the contents of the double boiler through a fine sieve, add 1&#189; cups of hot milk, 1 tablespoon of salt and a saltspoon of pepper, and return to the boiler. Beat 2 egg-yolks in &#189; cup of milk, and when the soup boils again stir them into it. Stir hard for one minute and serve.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch4.20" type="Section"><head>CREAM OF CHEESE</head><p>Put 1 quart (or 4 cups) of milk in a double boiler, and put with it &#190; of a cup of grated cheese, 1 teaspoon of grated onion, 1 teaspoon of some piquant sauce, &#188; teaspoon of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, and 1 tablespoon of flour and 1 of butter rubbed together. Stir until smooth, then beat the yolks of 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of milk, put in the tureen, and pour the boiling soup over them, stirring during the process.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch5.13" type="Section"><head>FRENCH OR GLOBE ARTICHOKES</head><p>The globe artichoke is a most delicious addition to a vegetarian menu, and it is not because it is not known to be edible, but because many people do not know how either to eat it or to serve it, that it is not oftener seen in America. I have had it served to me in almost every European country and often in restaurants in America, and have never encountered but one cook who knew how it should be sent to the table after cooking, and one waiter who knew how to serve it when it got there. It is usually served half cold with the leaves falling all about it because the &#8220;thistle,&#8221; and usually the best of the artichoke besides, has been carelessly removed in the kitchen; instead of which it should be served whole, as in this way only can it be kept hot enough to be palatable. The artichoke <pb id="pb83" n="83"/>should be set stem end downward on a hot, flat dish and wound about at the base with a small table napkin, and the person who serves it, holding it in the napkin, should reverse it and taking a small, sharp, silvered knife should cut through the artichoke on the bottom, using a sawing motion, and with the help of a serving fork ease apart the &#8220;thistle&#8221; and the closely knitted small leaves in the centre. Unless the artichokes are very large ones, a half of one is not too much to serve each person. The &#8220;thistle&#8221; should be removed by the server, and this should be done by carefully separating it from the &#8220;fond&#8221; or base, which is the fleshy part from which the leaves grow out. The leaves should be taken one by one, by the dry tip, in the fingers, and the fleshy end thus pulled from the base should be dipped in the sauce served, and the soft portion removed by drawing it between the front teeth; when the leaves are finished the base should be cut up with a fork and eaten with the sauce.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch5.14" type="Section"><head>TO STEAM GLOBE ARTICHOKES</head><p>Prepare for cooking as in the above recipe, place in a covered steamer, and let steam forty minutes or until the leaves, when pulled, part easily from the base.

Put them in cold salted water and a little vinegar for fifteen minutes to cleanse and free from insects, then put them in salted boiling water and boil until the leaves part easily from the base when pulled; this should be in about half an hour, <pb id="pb84" n="84"/>but the time varies with the age and size of the artichoke; it should then be drained and the stem cut off so that it will stand erect on the serving dish.

Put 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan, and when melted add 2 finely minced shallots (or use chives or onion tops), and 1 teaspoon of chopped parsley, and 1 cup of chopped fresh or canned mushrooms, salt and pepper, and fry all together for five minutes. Fill the artichoke with this, tie the leaves together and set in a pan containing 1 cup of stock (or water), 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil, and bake them half an hour, basting them thoroughly five or six times.

In the city, beets are seldom obtainable which require less than two or three hours&#8217; cooking; but really young, small beets should not require more than one hour&#8217;s boiling. When boiled they should be drained, then plunged into cold water, after which the skin can be rubbed off with the hand. Some, however, prefer that beets should be baked or steamed; the time required to cook will then be somewhat longer. Canned beets are a great convenience.

I would advise those who do not have potatoes served on the table which are white and floury and thoroughly cooked through, to see that one of the above-mentioned ways of cooking potatoes is carried out in their kitchens. Potatoes put in boiling water, or put in a covered steamer over rapidly boiling water, will cook in from twenty minutes to half an hour, the time depending, of course, upon the size and age of the potatoes; they should always be carefully scrubbed and cooked in their skins, and peeled afterwards.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch5.167" type="Section"><head>MASHED POTATOES</head><p>Having boiled or steamed the required number of potatoes, peel them as expeditiously as possible and break them up in a hot saucepan; mash and then beat them vigorously with a wooden spoon or a fork, add a generous piece of butter, dredge with salt and a little pepper, and beat them until they are light; then moisten slightly with a very little hot milk or cream, beat them for a moment more, and serve very hot.

Mash the potatoes with a wire potato-masher, add 1 tablespoon of butter for every 5 potatoes used, and season well with salt and pepper. Beat the whites of eggs very stiff, allowing 2 to every 5 potatoes, and mix them lightly through the potato with a fork; fill the potato skins with the mixture, heaping them full; brown them slightly in the oven before serving, and garnish the dish on which they are served with sprigs of parsley.

</p><p>To boil chestnuts put them, in their shells, in cold water and let them cook for five or six minutes after the water starts boiling, or put them in boiling water for ten or twelve minutes. Peel carefully, and serve after roasting or boiling with brown sauce or mushroom sauce, plain or in cases.

The instructions are to cover the saucepan closely after putting the eggs in the water, and let it stand on the back of the stove, the eggs to be removed in ten minutes if wanted soft, and in twenty minutes if liked well set. Hard-boiled eggs are certainly more palatable cooked in this way than when boiled for ten minutes in the ordinary way.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch12.2" type="Section"><head>FRIED EGGS</head><p>Put a little butter into a small frying pan, and when melted break an egg into a saucer, and slide it carefully into the hot butter, and let it fry until the white is thoroughly set, cooking as many as are required, separately, in the same way. If a tight cover is put over the frying pan when the egg is put in, the yolk of the egg will be as pink as a nicely poached egg when done. Season with pepper and salt before serving. A little Worcestershire sauce or walnut catsup heated in the pan and poured over fried eggs adds variety.

When the water reaches boiling point break the eggs carefully one by one into it, remove the pan from the intense heat, cover it, and let the eggs cook until the whites are firmly set. If the water is shallow the eggs will spread and be more flat, in which case the boiling water must be dipped up over the yolks with a spoon to make them pink; if the water is deep the eggs will be more round than flat. When the eggs are done lift them carefully from the water with a perforated strainer in order to drain off the water thoroughly, and serve them on hot toast.

<pb id="pb257" n="257"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch14" type="Chapter"><head>SALADS</head><p>There is no end to the combinations of vegetables for salads; the few here given are the best ones I have tried. The dressing should never be put on a fresh green salad until just as it is to be used; other salads, like potato, beans, etc., are sometimes improved by standing. Lettuce for salads should be carefully looked over; and clean, inner leaves not washed unless they are muddy; but all the leaves used which are washed should be thoroughly dried before adding the dressing. In France the salad basket is one of the most used kitchen utensils, and the salad leaves after washing are shaken in this until absolutely dry. The dressing should be very well mixed with the vegetables, and a little dry salt and pepper added as the salad is served.

</p><div2 id="ch14.1" type="Section"><head>FRENCH DRESSING</head><p>An absolute rule for making good salad dressing is an almost impossible thing, as this seems to be the one place in cookery where it is not only allowable but commendable to &#8220;guess&#8221; at proper proportions. The following is as nearly accurate as it seems well to be. Put 1 scant teaspoon of salt and 1 saltspoon of black pepper in a bowl, and stir into them with a wooden fork, very slowly, 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh oil, and then add half as much or less vinegar, mixing it well with the oil.

<pb id="pb258" n="258"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch14.2" type="Section"><head>TARRAGON VINEGAR</head><p>Good tarragon vinegar can be bought in any city, but it is so easily prepared at home that it is worth doing. Put a handful of tarragon in a quart jar, and cover with cold or heated vinegar. Seal the jar and set it in a dark place for a month or so before using.
</p><p>Make chervil vinegar in the same way.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch14.3" type="Section"><head>PLAIN MAYONNAISE DRESSING</head><p>Put 2 chilled egg-yolks in a cold soup plate, and stir into them 1 teaspoon of salt and &#189; teaspoon of mustard, using a silvered spoon, and after these are well mixed in begin to add oil, actually drop by drop, from 1 scant cup of cool olive oil, and do this until the eggs are so thickened that it is not possible to make them more so; then the remaining oil may be added less slowly. If this first process is not properly done, no amount of stirring will ever thicken the sauce. A fork or whisk may be used to finish the stirring. When the oil is added, beat in slowly 1 tablespoon of vinegar, and 1 of lemon juice, and &#189; saltspoon of cayenne pepper. Put on the ice until wanted.
</p><p>Tarragon mayonnaise is made by substituting tarragon vinegar for plain vinegar.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch14.4" type="Section"><head>GREEN COLOURING FOR MAYONNAISE</head><p>This may be made of mixed herbs or spinach.

Sift this onto &#189; a cup of cocoanut butter or &#189; a cup of butter, or these two in equal proportions, dampen with ice-water, and roll out five or six times. Keep ice-cold until used.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch17.2" type="Section"><head>EASY PUFF PASTE</head><p>Use a chopping bowl for mixing the paste, and into it put 4 cups of flour (sifted), 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of salt, adding it a spoonful at a time. Use 2 cups of butter, chopping it into the flour until it is as fine as possible. Beat 2 eggs for five minutes and add to them the juice of one lemon and &#189; cup of very cold water, and stir this gradually into the paste. When mixed lift the paste to a well-floured pastry board, roll it into a rectangular shape, fold it over onto itself from the four sides, then roll again, and repeat this process four times. Now fold into a thin piece of linen, and place on a plate near the ice in the refrigerator, and let it stand half an hour or more. Roll out again and use for patties, or pie-crust.

<pb id="pb288" n="288"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch17.3" type="Section"><head>TIMBALE CASES</head><p>Make a batter of &#190; of a cup of flour, &#189; cup of milk in which 1 egg has been beaten, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 saltspoon of salt, and at the very last add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Dip the timbale iron in the batter, then in hot vegetable fat, taking care it does not touch the bottom of the pan. When a golden brown remove and place on paper to drain, and proceed thus until a sufficient number has been made. Fill with chestnuts, mushrooms, etc., in sauce, and reheat in the oven after filling.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch17.4" type="Section"><head>BATTER FOR FRITTERS</head><p>Make as for timbale cases and dip the vegetables or fruit to be fried in it, and fry until golden brown in hot fat.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch17.5" type="Section"><head>PASTRY FOR PATTY PANS OR CASES</head><p>Instead of frying-batter for timbale cases a paste can be made with 1&#189; cups of flour, 1 egg-yolk, and 3 tablespoons of butter well-mixed and dampened to the proper consistency by using perhaps &#189; cup of cold water. Roll out very thin, about 1&#8260;1&#8203;6 of an inch, and press into the small pans or moulds after buttering them. Trim neatly, and press a little cup of buttered tissue paper in each, fill this with rice to protect the inside from too much heat and to keep flat on the bottom, and bake in a rather slow oven. Do not turn out until cooled, and do not fill until wanted.
</p><p>Ordinary pastry may be used also to line moulds for patty cases, timbales, etc.

<pb id="pb289" n="289"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch17.6" type="Section"><head>POTATO CRUST</head><p>Boil good-sized potatoes with the skins on, peel while hot, and press through a ricer or sieve, mix with an equal quantity of white flour or whole wheat flour and a little salt, and dampen with cream.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch17.7" type="Section"><head>ESSEX PASTRY</head><p>Mix equal parts of mashed potato and flour pastry, and use baked in small squares as a garnish, or as a covering for deep vegetable pie.

Stir into this 1 scant cup of milk, or just enough to make a dough that can scarcely be handled without sticking to the fingers. Drop in boiling vegetable stock or into a stew and let boil rapidly ten minutes, taking great care not to uncover the kettle until just as the dumplings are removed. Serve at once in the stew or with brown sauce.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch17.9" type="Section"><head>CROUTONS</head><p>Cut slices &#188; of an inch thick of stale bread, and with a knife cut across both ways to make tiny squares. Dry a few moments, then toss in a little hot butter to brown and serve warm.

<pb id="pb290" n="290"/></p></div2><div2 id="ch17.10" type="Section"><head>BREAD CRUMBS</head><p>A jar of bread crumbs should always be kept on hand. Use stale bread, break it into bits, and brown it slightly in the oven. Then with a roller, or in a mortar, crumble it and crush it to powdered crumbs. If a jar of light crumbs and one of golden brown crumbs are kept ready, they will be found most convenient.

It should then be rolled lightly with a roller to the thickness of three quarters of an inch, and with a biscuit cutter, the edge of which should be dipped in flour before using, cut the rounds quickly out and place them at once in a shallow buttered pan and set in the oven. They should be properly cooked in eighteen or twenty minutes. The smallest sized baking powder tin is exactly the right size for a biscuit cutter.
</p><p>This same recipe makes dumplings, strawberry short-cake, and the top of vegetable pies.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.2" type="Section"><head>POP OVERS</head><p>Mix 1 saltspoon of salt with 1 cup of flour, and add slowly enough from 1 cup of milk to just make a smooth <pb id="pb294" n="294"/>paste; stir this well, then add the remaining milk and the beaten yolk of 1 egg, and then the white whisked to a stiff froth. Put the batter in buttered gem pans or earthenware cups, and cook in the oven about twenty-five minutes, or until browned and standing very high. Serve at once.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.3" type="Section"><head>GRAHAM GEMS</head><p>Mix 2 cups of whole wheat flour, &#189; teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and stir onto this 1 cup of milk containing the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, then add the beaten whites of the eggs, and put in hot buttered gem pans. Bake about twenty-five minutes.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.4" type="Section"><head>TENNESSEE CORN BREAD</head><p>Beat 2 eggs in a mixing bowl, add 1 heaping teaspoon of granulated sugar, and 1 cup of milk; mix &#189; cup of white flour, 1 cup of yellow corn meal, and 3 teaspoons of baking powder, and sift these into the milk, stirring constantly. The batter should be thin enough to spread readily when poured into the inch-deep baking pan. Just before pouring in the batter put 1 tablespoon of butter in the baking tin and when it melts, stir the batter into it; this is the secret of crisp brown bottom crust and was learned from an old negro cook. Bake twenty minutes to half an hour or until tinged with brown.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.5" type="Section"><head>SOUTHERN RICE MUFFINS</head><p>With 1 cup of boiled rice put 1 cup of milk, 1 tablespoon of butter, the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, 1&#189; cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar, &#189; teaspoon of salt, and 1 <pb id="pb295" n="295"/>heaping teaspoon of baking powder. After mixing well add the well-beaten whites of the eggs, pour into hot buttered gem pans, and bake in a quick oven from twenty to twenty-five minutes.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.6" type="Section"><head>RICE GRIDDLECAKES</head><p>Mix well together 2 eggs, 2 cups of milk, &#189; teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 2 cups of flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1&#189; cups of boiled rice. Bake on a hot buttered griddle, browning both sides.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.7" type="Section"><head>CORN CAKES</head><p>In 1&#189; cups of sour milk put 1 teaspoon of soda, 1 beaten egg, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 scant &#189; cup of white flour, and thicken with enough yellow corn meal to make a thin batter. Fry a golden brown on a hot buttered griddle.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.8" type="Section"><head>WHEAT CAKES</head><p>Beat 2 eggs lightly and pour over them 2 cups of milk; mix 2 teaspoons of baking powder with 2 cups of flour and &#189; teaspoon of salt, and sift lightly into the milk, stirring constantly. Cook in small pancakes on a hot buttered griddle.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.9" type="Section"><head>GINGERBREAD</head><p>Beat the yolks of 2 eggs lightly, melt &#189; cup of butter and add to the eggs, then stir in &#189; cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of soda, and 1&#189; cups of dark molasses. Then add slowly <pb id="pb296" n="296"/>3 cups of sifted flour and 1 tablespoon of ginger, and after beating the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth stir them in with a fork. Bake in an inch-deep baking pan in a slow oven for three quarters of an hour.

</p></div2><div2 id="ch18.10" type="Section"><head>SUNDAY MORNING WAFFLES</head><p>Beat 2 eggs thoroughly, and add to them 2 cups of milk and 1 saltspoon of salt, and sift into the milk 2 cups of flour containing 2 heaping teaspoons of baking powder, stirring constantly. Some flour thickens more than others, and if more must be added sift it before stirring in. The secret of the excellence of waffles is not getting the batter too thick; it must spread readily when put upon the iron but not run. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter and put it in the batter at the last moment. Butter the hot waffle iron, using a bristle brush an inch or so wide for the purpose, over half-fill the iron with batter (using a large spoon), let one side brown, and then turn, to brown the other. Divide into the four parts indicated by the iron and serve with maple syrup.
